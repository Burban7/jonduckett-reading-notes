- Pages will use headings, subheadings, quote-boxes, lists, etc.

- HTML code is made up of characters that are contained inside angled brackets, called ***HTML Elements***.
  - HTML Elements are typically made up of an opening tag (***`<>`***) and a closing tag (***`</>`***).
  - Each HTML Elements tells the browser something about the information inside of the tags.
